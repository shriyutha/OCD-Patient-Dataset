# OCD Patient Dataset: Demographics & Clinical Data

### Introduction:
This project will analyze an OCD Patient Dataset: Demographics & Clinical Data, and to build a model for Depression Diagnosis and to extract insights from patient features.

The dataset is prepared, explored, and used to train classification models mainly (Logistic Regression and Random Forest).

In this notebook will show a preprocessing, train/test splitting, model training, and the evaluation output.

### Summary:

EDA and the graphs showed there is no major differences in age or symptom duration across gender or marital status groups.

Statistical tests called t-test & ANOVA confirmed no significant group differences, matching visual results.

ML model Logistic Regression achieved moderate accuracy 56%, indicating limited predictive power.

Overall, clinical features predict depression better than demographics, and more detailed symptom data is needed to improve model performance.
